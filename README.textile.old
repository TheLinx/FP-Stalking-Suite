h1. The FP Stalking suite!

All these scripts are meant to be run by a Lua 5.1 intepreter.
You'll need LuaSocket and LuaFilesystem too.

h2. fpstalk.lua

Run this script to automatically download the Facepunch cameras every 5/10 seconds (depending on camera).
It will download into a folder named after the current date in the directory it is run.

h2. moviegen.lua

Run this script to start a guide to generate a movie out of the dumped images.
It assumes that ffmpeg and mencoder are both installed and in your PATH.

h2. ytupload.lua

This script is supposed to upload stuff to Youtube, but it doesn't work.
:(
